## Description

Developing an API for the wishlists service.
In it, each registered user can tell what kind of gift he would like to receive, as well as chip in for a gift for another user, indicating the amount he is willing to spend on it.
So that you can check the functionality of the written service, we have prepared a frontend for you [the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/yandex-praktikum/kupipodariday-frontend) and [the description of the service API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/zlocate/KupiPodariDay/1.0.0).
